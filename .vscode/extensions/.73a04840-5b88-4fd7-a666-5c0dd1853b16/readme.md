### Telemetry
The AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this data helps to debug issues, such as compiler crashes, slow compilation times, and to prioritize new features.

The extension respects the Visual Studio Code setting for [telemetry reporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry). While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in [disable telemetry reporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting).
